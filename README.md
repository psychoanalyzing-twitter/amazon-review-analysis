# Amazon Review Rating Classification

A project which was an assignment for our Text Analytics course @ Heriot Watt Uni. This project uses a scraped dataset of amazon reviews across various categories of items and their ratings'.

## Motivation

This project aimed to develop a ML model to accurately predict the rating given using the review's text. 

## Method and results

### Methods 
The standard NLP workflow is abided by. What was done in each step of the workflow is briefly described below:

1. **Data Exploration and Visualization**.
2. **Text Processing and Normalization**. 
3. **GridSearch over Text Vectorization Techniques and Classifiers**. 
4. **Sequence Modelling - Deep Learning**. 
5. **Topic Modelling**. 


# Results
